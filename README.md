Banana RDF
==========

An RDF library in Scala
-----------------------

The goals are:

* to follow **carefully** the [RDF model](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-syntax)
* to be fully compatible with existing RDF Java libraries like Jena and Sesame
* to be type-safe
* to provide a simple yet powerful API to manipulate RDF

How to start geeking
--------------------

You only need a recent version of Java, that's all:

    $ git clone git@github.com:betehess/pimp-my-rdf.git
    $ cd pimp-my-rdf
    $ ./sbt
